### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `UninurseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `UninurseBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `UninurseBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the UniNurse book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all of its saved versions.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* _Diagram to be updated with new `Patient`attributes ..._
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in `UniNurse`, which `Person` references. This allows `UniNurse` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Uninurse book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `UninurseBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.uninurse.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Task viewing feature

#### Implementation

The viewing of tasks that are associated with patients can be achieved using the following 2 commands.

* `listTask` to list all tasks associated to all patients.
* `viewTask PATIENT_INDEX` to list task associated to the patient at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX`.

<br>

The `listTask` command is executed when the user enters the command into the UI which is handled by `ListTaskCommand`. Note that the command does not accept any arguments, hence there is no need for a `ListTaskCommandParser` to be created.

The change is reflected in the UI by calling `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` with the predicate that returns true if a patient in the list has associated tasks. This currently only updates the patient list panel to display patients that have associated tasks and does not update the output panel. (Future implementations would update the output panel to display all tasks associated with all patients.)

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` component when the command is being executed.

<img src="images/ListTaskSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

<br>

The `viewTask` command is executed when the user enters the command into the UI which is handled by `ViewTaskCommand`. Since the command requires an argument `PATIENT_INDEX`, a `ViewTaskCommandParser` is created to determine the validity of the arguments provided. Given that valid arguments are provided, the command is then executed in the following manner.

1. The `Patient` at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX` is retrieved from the `lastShownList` obtained from the `Model` component.
1. The `Model` component updates its current list with `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to display only the specified `Patient`.
1. The `UI` component updates its result display by displaying the feedback message from `ViewTaskCommand`.
1. The `UI` component updates its output panel by displaying a `TaskListPanel`.

Note that `TaskListPanel` only displays the complete list of tasks of the specified patient and essential information such as the patient name and tags.

The following sequence diagrams illustrates the interactions between the `UI`, `Logic` and `Model` component when the command is being executed.

<img src="images/ViewTaskSequenceDiagram1.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/ViewTaskSequenceDiagram2.png" width="500" />

### Viewing tasks on a particular day feature

#### Implementation

The `tasksOn` command parses the user input and generates a `DateTime` object, however the time fields are default values since we only care about the particular Date, the it filters each patient by whether they have a 
task on the given Date. Each patient themselves filter their TaskList to arrive at the conclusion on whether they have a task on the given Date. Then the Model is set to show the filtered Patients, each with their own TaskList to also 
only the Tasks on the given Date.

The Sequence diagram below shows the execution of a tasksOn command

![tasksOnSequenceDiagram](images/TasksOnSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature
### Add/delete medical conditions from patients

Users can add a medical condition to a particular patient by providing the following details:
1. The patient's index number shown in the displayed patient list.
2. The condition to be added.

There are two ways a user can add a medical condition:
1. Add multiple medical conditions at one go when the user first creates a patient.
2. Add one condition at a time to an existing patient.

#### Implementation

A medical condition is represented by `Condition`, and multiple conditions are stored internally as a `ConditionList`.
`ConditionList` facilitates the add/delete condition mechanism, and each patient only has one associated `ConditionList`.
`ConditionList` mainly implements the following operations:
* `ConditionList#add()`: adds a condition to the patient's list of conditions.
* `ConditionList#delete()`: removes a condition from the patient's list of conditions.

Figure 1 below summarises what happens when a user executes an add condition command on a specified patient:
<figure>
    <img src="images/AddConditionActivityDiagram.png" alt="add_condition_activity_diagram"/>
    <figcaption>
        <em>Figure 1: Activity diagram showing the flow of events when a user executes an add condition command</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Interactions 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add condition mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes the `addCondition 1 c/Diabetes` command to add a condition to the first patient in the
displayed patient list.

2. `UninurseBookParser#parseCommand()` parses the command word `addCondition`, and then creates a corresponding `AddConditionCommandParser` object.

3. `AddConditionCommandParser#parse()` parses the patient index `1` and the condition `Diabetes` provided, and then creates an `AddConditionCommand` object.

4. The `AddConditionCommand` object interacts with the `Model` to add a condition to the specified patient's condition list.

5. `Logic` returns a `CommandResult` object, which encapsulates the result of the execution of the add condition command.

Figure 2 below shows how `Logic` executes the add condition operation:
<figure>
    <img src="images/AddConditionSequenceDiagram.png" alt="add_condition_sequence_diagram"/>

</figure>

_To be updated with details of delete condition feature ..._

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `PersistentUninurseBook`. It consists of a list of `UninurseBookSnapshot`, which itself consists of a `UninurseBook` and a `CommandResult`. `PersistentUninurseBook` stores the saved versions of all `UninurseBook`s, stored internally as:
* `workingCopy`, which is the current (possibly unsaved) version of `UninurseBook`.
* `uninurseBookVersions` and `currentVersion`, which are the saved versions of `UninurseBook`s and which version we last replaced `workingCopy` with.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `PersistentUninurseBook#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current Uninurse book state (i.e. `workingCopy`) in its history, along with the command result message.
* `PersistentUninurseBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous Uninurse book state from its history.
* `PersistentUninurseBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone Uninurse book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `PersistentUninurseBook` will be initialized with the initial Uninurse book state, and the `currentVersion` pointing to that single Uninurse book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete -p 5` command to delete the 5th person in the Uninurse book. The `delete` command calls `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, causing the modified state of the Uninurse book after the `delete -p 5` command executes to be saved in the `uninurseBookVersions` along with the `CommandResult` of the `delete` command, and the `currentVersion` is shifted to the newly inserted Uninurse book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, causing another modified Uninurse book state and the `CommandResult` of the `add` command to be saved into the `uninurseBookVersions`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, so the Uninurse book state will not be saved into the `uninurseBookVersions`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentVersion` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Uninurse book state, and restores the Uninurse book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentVersion` is at index 0, pointing to the initial UninurseBook state, then there are no previous UninurseBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canundo()` to check if this is the case.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentVersion` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Uninurse book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentVersion` is at index `uninurseBookVersions.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Uninurse book state, then there are no undone UninurseBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canredo()` to check if this is the case.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the Uninurse book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `uninurseBookVersions` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`. Since the `currentVersion` is not pointing at the end of the `uninurseBookVersions`, all Uninurse book states after the `currentVersion` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Uninurse book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Feature: UpdatedPersonCard for UI
#### Implementation:
Adding/editing/deleting a patient would have a `UpdatedPersonCard` with the patientâ€™s details appear in the `OutputPanel` of the `UI`. The possible commands to achieve this are:
1. add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [d/TASK_DESCRIPTION]â€¦ [t/TAG]â€¦
2. edit -p PATIENT_INDEX
3. delete -p PATIENT_INDEX 

When the user enters any of the above 3 inputs, `UninurseBookParser` parses the inputs and returns the appropriate `Command` (i.e. `AddPatientCommand`, `EditPatientCommand`, or `DeletePatientCommand`) to `LogicManager`. Once the `Command` is executed, the patient is then set as the `patientOfInterest` in the `Model` by calling the `Model#setPatientOfInterest()` method. 

Below is a sequence diagram to show the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` components for **adding a patient** (sequence is similar for editing and deleting a patient):



<img src="images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram3.png"  />

After that, `MainWindow` would call `LogicManager#getPatientOfInterest()` to retrieve the required patient. Thereafter, assuming a patient is added, `MainWindow` calls `OutputPanel#handleAddPatient()` with the patient as a parameter, which would then create a `UpdatedPersonCard` with the patientâ€™s details which appears in the `OutputPanel`.

Below is the sequence diagram which shows the entire interaction between the `UI`, `Logic`, and `Model` components for **adding a patient** (sequence is similar for editing and deleting a patient):
